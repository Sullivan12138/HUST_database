# HUST_database
This is my database experiment code, writtten by java.
To run the file, you need to install jdk8 and IDEA, also import the jfoenix jar and jdbc jar.
You need to install MySql, create a database named "warehouse" and add two additional users to it: user named "caigou" @ '%' with password
"12" and user named "xiaoshou" @ '%' with password "12".
The .rar file is the compressed file of my experiment, please omit the other files(they are source code), just download this file and unzip it.
